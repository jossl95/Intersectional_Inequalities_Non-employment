### Abstract:
In this article we study to what extent intersectional sex- and country of 
origin differences in non-employment in the Netherlands are mediated by 
social capital. Hypotheses are formulated based on literature concerning 
intersectionality, social resources, traditional gender roles and 
homogeneous preferences. We expect that certain groups are more vulnerable 
to non-employment than other groups, in part because fewer of their strong 
social ties are currently active in the labour market. We estimated 
structural equation models using data from the LISS-panel. We find that 
having fewer ties that have paid employment is linked to a higher chance 
of being non-employed. Moreover, we find that people from certain social 
groups have a higher chance of being unemployed. For women with a western 
migration background we find that a part of the higher risk for 
non-employment can be attributed to a lack of social capital.
